# Tower Defense Project   

A simple 2D tower defense game. Consists of 3 enemy types and 3 towers that shoot different projectiles.
Only a single level or scene was created but the main parts are in place (scripts and gamemanager and animations), would only have to move checkpoints and ground tiles around to create new levels.  
Placing towers cost money, killing enemies earn money. After clicking a tower button a sprite follows the mouse and will change color depending if it can be placed on the tile below and if there are sufficient funds. green = placeable, red = not placeable.
